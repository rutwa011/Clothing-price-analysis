# Clothing-price-analysis
The project aims to examine clothing prices across online retailers like Ajio, Myntra, and Flipkart. It focuses on specific clothing categories such as casual wear, formal wear, and sportswear, along with popular brands within each category. By crawling data from these websites, the project implements features to collect and analyze the data, compiling a list of clothing items based on specific criteria like price trends, brand popularity, and quantity considerations. This analysis helps customers to make informed decisions when shopping for clothes online.
